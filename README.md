# web_demo1

A project I wrote while getting my associates degree.

This project incorporated the following: Xampp, Apache, myphpAdmin.

Database was lost after the hard drive that contained the localhost database was corrupted, the code for creating the database was also lost.

This project took a lot of inspiration from the [scryfall](https://scryfall.com/) website.

This video is a short demonstration of an earlier stage of the project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjnIMVp6tk .

Work after this demnostration incorporated adding in a login system to "secure" the ability to modify the database from the site itself, when logged in you could create, update, delete, and otherwise modify entries in the database from the site with built in UI.
