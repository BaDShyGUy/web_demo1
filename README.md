# web_demo1

A project I wrote while getting my associates degree.

This project incorporated the following: Xampp, Apache, myphpAdmin.

Database was lost after the hard drive that contained the localhost database was corrupted, the code for creating the database was also lost.

This project took a lot of inspiration from the scryfall website.

This video is a short demonstration of an earlier stage of the project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYjnIMVp6tk .
